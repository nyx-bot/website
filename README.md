## here's nyx's website!!

this isn't open source for people to run on their own systems (though i absolutely won't stop you from doing so), it's primarily open source for transparency.

if you do however want to run the website on your own system, make sure you clone it via [the git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads), as the website has its own auto-update feature.
